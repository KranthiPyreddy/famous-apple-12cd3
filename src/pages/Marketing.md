      We have two kinds of customers the

      1. Hospitals, Pharmacies

      2. Patients


      Hospitals, pharmacies can also be considered as investors as we are going
      to get major amount

      of from them in them by advertising their products and services. However,
      for Electronic

      health records the target customers are mainly people ranging between 13 â€“
      50 years in age

      and India has a large population in this age range. Also, 90% people in
      that age range in India

      have cell phone where our application will be released. Customers above 50
      years old are less

      likely to be inclined towards using a web application for their health
      records. However, we

      will try to educate them with different campaigns.


      In order to get hospitals and pharmacies

      to collaborate with our venture we will majorly use digital marketing.

      As for patients we would use digital and print media, we would advertise
      in collaborated

      hospitals, pharmacies extensively in the form of print media and through
      digital media in the

      region in which collaborated hospitals and pharmacies are situated.


      Marketing budget:

      1. Digital Marketing: A Facebook Ad can cost 76 rupees which is
      approximately $ 1.5 per day toadvertise in India. Similarly, to advertise
      in YouTube it will cost at least $10 per day for local

      campaigns. So, if we post 3 Ads per week in Facebook it might cost us
      approximately $18 for a month of Facebook advertising. Also assume we
      posted a video on YouTube only on

      weekends. It would cost us $80 per month with least amount. Together
      digital marketing

      budget for one year is around $1200

      2. Print Media Marketing Budget: To advertise a poster for a week in India
      would cost around

      $20. So, for a year it would cost around $1100 and a Billboard
      advertisement may cost around

      $100-$1000 per month depending on place and size of the billboard

      With the above figures marketing budget for marketing would be $5000 per
      year
