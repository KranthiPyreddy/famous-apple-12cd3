      Our vision is to create a website which makes health records easy and
      quick accessible for authorised users.
      Electronic Health Records mainly focus on integrating pharmacists,
      doctors, and patients on one platform.
      Our vision is divided into two parts. First is to make a web application
      which is very user friendly i.e. easy to understand and use. Since there
      are still many who are not very comfortable to use modern applications
      on phone and computer despite having one as the applications online
      are very complicated to users, so we want to make this application very
      simple. We will also setup a help desk to solve all the queries.
      Second, we want to make the health records access safe and secure.
      As the health data is very sensitive, we will make sure it is accessible
      only to authorised persons. For instance, a pharmacist will only be able
      to see prescriptions from doctor but not all the medical history of a
      patient. Similarly, only patient himself and authorised doctors will be
      able to see all patientsâ€™ files. A doctor from different hospital will be
      able to access a patient files from another hospital only when patient
      permits him or when patient is admitted in his hospital.
