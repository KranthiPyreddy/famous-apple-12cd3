      1. **Loyalty programs:** Points or offers to membership customers will
      help promote the application and maintain a relationship with our regular
      customers.

      2. **Feedback surveys:** Regular feedback surveys help to improve the
      service provided to customers. This also helps to know where the net
      promoter square of our venture stands.

      3. **24*7 Support:** round the clock support really helps to maintain the
      relationship with the customer. It makes them feel they will have help all
      the time in case anything goes wrong with the application.

      4. **Student offers:** Students specially teens and youth influence their
      older family members to try new products and applications. For instance,
      my mother who is in her 50â€™s started using amazon prime after I
      recommended. I used amazon prime in the first place as they have a 50% off
      on student accounts. Now one year after recommendation my mother uses
      Amazon prime extensively. So, this word of mouth from younger generation
      increases the customer base

      5. **Offers on holidays/ popular seasons:** October - February is Flu
      season. So if we have offers on drugs related to flu. People would like to
      signup for our website.
